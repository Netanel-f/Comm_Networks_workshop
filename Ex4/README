The program is Server-Client application to test throughput of both protocols.
The code is build from handlers and setters for EAGER/RENDEZVOUS protocols.
in both cases a connection is setup using TCP/IP and then an IB connection is set between the two devices.
I have chose to build 3 different modules, one for each use: Server, Client & Indexer.
KV_server is storing key-value pairs.
KV_Indexer is using hash function to determine which kv_server is responsible for the key's value.
kv_client - a client.

Part 2 is a web server using our solution to part 1, in order to reply for HTTP requests.

I have tested throught put of part 1 on this environment:
-An instance of kv_indexer & kv_client running on mlx-stud-01
-2 instances of kv_server running on mlx-stud-02 & mlx-stud-03


Part 1 Results:
Value size: 1	Bytes,	Throughput: 5.916	Mbps
Value size: 2	Bytes,	Throughput: 6.804	Mbps
Value size: 4	Bytes,	Throughput: 8.116	Mbps
Value size: 8	Bytes,	Throughput: 11.022	Mbps
Value size: 16	Bytes,	Throughput: 17.712	Mbps
Value size: 32	Bytes,	Throughput: 28.544	Mbps
Value size: 64	Bytes,	Throughput: 5.326	Mbps
Value size: 128	Bytes,	Throughput: 95.691	Mbps
Value size: 256	Bytes,	Throughput: 13.489	Mbps
Value size: 512	Bytes,	Throughput: 5.698	Mbps
Value size: 1	KBytes,	Throughput: 4.139	Mbps
Value size: 2	KBytes,	Throughput: 3.815	Mbps
Value size: 4	KBytes,	Throughput: 117.616	Mbps
Value size: 8	KBytes,	Throughput: 380.917	Mbps
Value size: 16	KBytes,	Throughput: 1.192	Gbps
Value size: 32	KBytes,	Throughput: 1.239	Gbps


We didnt had any instruction regarding how to examine part 2 throughput.
